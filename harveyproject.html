						This is the most recent project I've done with HTML & CSS & JS, I will be constantly updating this website according to my career updates. I’ve done many websites and projects before on a much larger scale with more people and higher difficulty level, but I choose to put this project on my number one project list because this is the first online&functional website I build with the knowledge I learned completely from online. My friend Michael, who’s an very inspiring software engineer at Amazon told me to be a good software engineer one must learn how to self teach and utilize resources online. I’ve always believed in this, and I’m glad I’m able to master this crucial skill.

						<h3>
							Bank is the largest JAVA project I have done using Hashsets and ArrayLists, this is my final project for my ZeroToInternShip course, in this project there are five classes: BankInterface, Bank, Account, Transactions, and User. BankInterface creates banks. In the Bank class home page there are 10 options (Methods) for the user to choose to execute; Create Account, Delete Account, Transfer to , Deposit, Withdraw, Show Acc details, Delete User, Log out, Exit, Spend. The entire Bank is set up as Run the program --> show home page --> Register as an User --> Go to User home page --> log in to your Account --> choose from any of the 10 options above --> ex. create a new Account(Checking/Saving) this account will go under this user, a user can have maximum 5 accounts. I used a HastSet so whenever a User is created it is linked with an ArrayList called Accounts, there can be maximum 5 accounts, within each account there is another ArrayList Transactions that tranks every transactions made with this account.

							This was the first team project that I participated along with 50 other individuals from designing, coding to building and testing. Every year we build a new robot that is goal oriented to complete certain tasks to compete in the FIRST Robotics competition. We build the 2017 robot with a budget of $70,000 to compete in 2017 FIRST Robotics competitions, such as chezy champs, 2017 off-season competition, 2017 seasonal competition, mad town competition and etc.  To know more about this us visite our robotics website to know more. http://frc971.org/content/2017-software
