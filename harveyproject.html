					This is the most recent project I've done with HTML & CSS & JS, I will be constantly updating this website according to my career updates. I’ve done many websites and projects before on a much larger scale with more people and higher difficulty level, but I choose to put this project on my number one project list because this is the first online&functional website I build with the knowledge I learned completely from online. My friend Michael, who’s an very inspiring software engineer at Amazon told me to be a good software engineer one must learn how to self teach and utilize resources online. I’ve always believed in this, and I’m glad I’m able to master this crucial skill.
